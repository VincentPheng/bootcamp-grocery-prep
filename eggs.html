            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5 eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp white pepper</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp MSG/Chicken boullion powder</li>
                <li>(Optional)1/2 tsp Shaoxing Wine</li>
                <li>1tsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>1tbsp water</li>
                <li>1 tsp sesame oil or lard (Neutral flavored oil such as vegetable oil will also work)</li>
                <li>(Optional) 1/2 lb. of shrimp, cooked</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Crack the five eggs into a bowl and whisk until you see large bubbles form</li>
                <li>Combine the cornstarch and water to make a cornstarch slurry and add that to the egg mixture</li>
                <li>Add the rest of the seasonings into the egg mixture and whisk until you can see bubbles again</li>
                <li>Add the shrimp at this step as well if you have any.</li>
                <li>Heat the sesame oil or lard in a non stick skillet until it starts steaming, then add the eggs. After this you must act quickly as the intense heat will quickly set the eggs</li>
                <li>When the outer edges begin to set, pull the cooked bits to one side of the skillet. Now move the skillet so that the uncooked part is over the flame.</li>
                <li>Again, when it begins to set, layer the newly cooked sided up and over the the previous layer</li>
                <li>Continue this process until all the egg is set and cooked. If the pan starts getting too hot, feel free to take it off the heat for a moment to let it cool down before continuing</li>
                <li>Cut the finshed scrambled egg in half and stack them on top of each other. Garnish with scallions if available</li>
            </ol>
