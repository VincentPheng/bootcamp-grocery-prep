                <p>
                    Hey everybody! I'm Vincent and I've been a homecook for about 4 years now. <br> <br>
                    I remember the first thing I ever cooked when my mom first let me was just simple over easy eggs that I somehow managed to burn. <br>
                    I'm happy to say though that I have grown much since then as a homecook, learning and absorbing hundreds of recipes from a wide <br>
                    range of cultures, but I'm well aware that I have much to learn still. <br><br>
                    I mostly specialize in seafood and asian cuisine, so most of the recipes that you'll see curated by me will be along those lines. <br>
                    Knife's Edge has given me the platform I needed to share my love for cooking and I hope we can be your go-to for your next dinner date recipes!
