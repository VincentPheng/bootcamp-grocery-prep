            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large pot of water until steaming, then add the salt. Continue heating until the water boils</li>
                <li>While waiting for the water to come to a boil, chop up your pork meat of choice into short strips</li>
                <li>Finely grate the parmesean. Set aside about a quarter of the cheese for later</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg yolks and whole eggs until no egg white streaks remain. Stir in the remaining grated cheese. Add pepper to the egg mixture to your tastes</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium then add the meat, stirring occasionally until crisp</li>
                <li>Fish out the meat with a wooden spoon and transfer to a small bowl. Discard most of the fat, leaving only a thin layer at the bottom of the pot</li>
                <li>Drop in the pasta into the bowling water and, just before the pasta is done cooking according to the instrcutions, scoop out about a cup of the pasta water for later</li>
                <li>Drain the pasta and add it to the pot with fat from earlier, cooking over medium-high heat</li>
                <li>Keep cooking the pasta, stirring and occasionally for about 2 minutes</li>
                <li>Slowly drizzle in the egg mixture from earlier. Make sure you continue stirring constantly until the pasta thickens up</li>
                <li>If the pasta becomes too thick, you can thin it out with the pasta water from earlier.</li>
                <li>Stir in the pork and plate up. Add anymore pepper and the parmesean you saved earlier.</li>
            </ol>
